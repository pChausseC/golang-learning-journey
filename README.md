# Go Learning Journey 🧠

This repository is a chronicle of my journey learning the Go programming language. It contains hands-on exercises, experiments, and small projects to reinforce core concepts.

## 🗂️ Structure

- `00-hello-world`: First Go program
- `01-basics`: Syntax, variables, functions
- `02-structs-interfaces`: Go's type system
- `03-concurrency`: Goroutines and channels
- `04-apis`: RESTful APIs using standard library and Gin
- `05-projects`: Showcase mini-projects

## 🧪 What's Next

- Add authentication to the URL shortener
- Use goroutines to scrape data concurrently
- Deploy one API to Render or Railway

## 🛠 Tools

- Go 1.21+
- VSCode + Go plugin
- `golangci-lint`, `delve` for debugging
